### Process and Problem Solving
- For this project, I started building the back-end API using Django. Once that was working, I moved on to the front-end, for which I used React. When I ran into problems, I tested out a variety of possible solutions before submitting issues. I also collaborated with peers to help debug.

### Unsolved Problems For Future Iterations
- For future versions of this app, I want to turn it into a social media platform for songwriters and producers to share their work with peers. I want the user to be able to create a profile. I also want to also add audio and video uploading capabilities so users can share their works in progress.
